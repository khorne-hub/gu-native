// The port's chat (S32, after tabarong's design PORT_CHAT.md): three chats and friends, with no server of the project's
// and no account. The same files are in both ports (MHGU: runtime/chat, MH4U for Android: app_native/chat); each port
// gives what differs (Port below) and draws it in its own menu.
//
//   - Hub: the hub (MHGU) or room (MH4U) the player is in, over the link the games already keep between them: MHGU's
//     F_AUX messages, which the hub's host checks and passes on (MHGU runtime/chat_port.cpp), MH4U's room chat
//     (Azahar's, so an emulator's players in the room read it too). Nothing else is needed: no relay, no notice.
//   - Global (both games, every port's player) and General (this game's), friends' private messages and whether a
//     friend is online: Nostr events on open public relays (wss://, the player can change the list). Ephemeral events
//     (kinds 20000-29999): a relay passes them on to whoever is connected and keeps none, so the chat works only while
//     connected, and nothing said is archived. Private messages are encrypted (NIP-44 v2): the relays see who writes to
//     whom, not what. The relays are behind chat_ws.h, and the Nostr part behind a few functions here: another transport
//     can take their place.
//
// The player's identity is a key made on the device the first time (chat.txt), shown as a friend code (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX:
// chat_crypto.h). Every message is signed with it, so nobody can write as someone else. Friends, mutes, blocks and the
// chat's settings live in the same file: deleting the app loses them, and that is fine. Nothing said is written to disk.
//
// Moderation is each player's own: mute (their lines no longer show) and block (no lines, private messages, friend
// requests or presence; out of the friends) act only on the device of the player who does it. Against spam: a player
// can send a line every few seconds and the same line once a minute, and someone who sends too many is silenced here for
// a few minutes.
//
// Threads: every function may be called from the interface's thread; the relays are served by a thread of their own,
// the hub's messages arrive on the link's threads (hub_line).
